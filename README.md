Analysis of U.S. Wage Stagnation: Examining whether productivity, or college Degree, Training, or other requirements led to less wage stagnation since the 1980s. 

As mentioned by numerous news articles, U.S. wages have largely stagnated (ie, in real terms & adjusted for inflation) over much of the period since the late 1970s or early 1980s. However, the extent of wage stagnation has varied by industry, as shown in this 2019 article: [Wage stagnation by Industry](https://www.liveabout.com/industries-with-the-most-wage-stagnation-4176877). 

Inb this repo, I will do some data analysis to examine differences in wage stagnation by specific occupations. 

In particular, I'd like to examine whether occupations that (at least tend to) require college degrees, apprenticeships, or other forms of medium or high skill training or expertise tended to have lower wage stagnation. 

In addition, while overall wage gains have generally not kept up page with labor productivity, has this relationship between labor productivity and wage growth differed over time among different occupations and industries? And have some industries had not only stagnated in wage growth but also been stagnant in labor productivity? 

Also along the lines of labor productivity, do occupations that have coillege degree or high-skill apprenticeships or training have higher labor productivity on average?

Depending on availability of data, I will ideally try to find state, city, or county-level data, with a preference towards more granular, less aggregated data. 

To-Dos:
1) Discern what data I can use to quantify real wage growth by industry and ideally by occupation in the U.S. since the 1980s. 

--Possible data sources could include: 
BLS;
Census;


2) Similarly, find data on labor productivity by industry and/or occupation. Similar sources could contain these data.
